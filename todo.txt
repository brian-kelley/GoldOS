GoldOS Todo list

PROGRESS - (high) stdlib.h function implementations
PROGRESS - (high) stdio.h functions
- (high) ELF32 executable loader 
- (high) Editor (built-in to kernel for now)
- (low) only move cursor down one line when valid process is started AND it writes to stdout
- (low) PS/2 mouse driver, cursor drawing
- (low) have the keyboard interrupt only place a stroke in a circular queue instead of actually calling the key listener from the interrupt handler
- (high) vertical sync (read from 0x3DA, bit 3)
- (high) graphics library (2D primitives, then textures, then matrices for 3D, depth buffer, and simple lighting. Also put keyboard/mouse input functions.
- (med) double buffering
- (high) change 256-color palette at initialization to be RGB-323
- (low) make graphics support mode 12h also, make the entire API work the same in modes 12h and 13h, and use dithering to simulate more colors
- (high) Assembler (support just int operations first, then x87 FPU instructions and immediate float/double values
- (high) C compiler
- (high) ELF32 linker to build libraries and executables to make self-hosted
- optimized realloc in memory.c, rather than wasteful c++ new/copy/delete

----------------Self-hosted!----------------

- (low) change core utilities to standalone executables, compiled in the OS. (ls, mkdir, cd, etc.)
- (high) basic UX customizations
- (high) games! (pong, snake, platformers, etc.)
- GUI
